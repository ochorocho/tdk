# TDK - Proof of Concept

Ease the TYPO3 Composer based Contribution Setup.
Run `composer create-project ochorocho/tdk <target-folder-name>` and answer
the command prompts as needed. If you want the current dev version add `--stability=dev`
to the command.

This command guides you through the process of setting up a
composer based TYPO3 CoreDev environment.
