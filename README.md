# TDK - Proof of Concept

Ease the TYPO3 Composer based Contribution Setup.
Run `composer create-project ochorocho/tdk <target-folder-name>` and answer
the command prompts as needed. If you want the current dev version add `--stability=dev`
to the command.

This command guides you through the process of setting up a
composer based TYPO3 CoreDev environment.

## Command prompts

  which in most cases is your http://my.typo3.org login 
* Setup Commit Message Hook? [y/n] : default=y
* Setup Pre Commit Hook? [y/n] : default=y
* Create a basic ddev config? [y/n] : default=y
